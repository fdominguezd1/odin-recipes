    <h2> Ajiaco, the famous colombian chicken soup</h2>

    <p>Ajiaco bogotano or santafereño is a typical soup from the area of Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Colombia.
        It contains prey or shredded chicken, creole, pastusa and sabanera potatoes, corn on the cob and optionally 
        capers and cream.</p>
        
    <p>Contrary to what its name suggests, ajiaco is not spicy. Because of the important cultural role 
        it plays, it is considered a Santa Fe tradition (after the colonial name of the city, Santa Fe).</p>

    <p>It consists of a chicken soup containing three types of potatoes (criolla, pastusa and sabanera), 
        usually served in earthenware bowls. The ajiaco usually includes baby corn cobs, and optionally 
        milk cream and pickled capers. The three types of potatoes provide creaminess thanks to the different levels of cooking; 
        the most important is the arracacha, which is a plant whose tuber is edible and bright yellow, 
        giving it its characteristic color.</p>
        
    <p>Another fundamental ingredient of ajiaco is guasca, an herb that gives it its most characteristic 
        flavor. The dish is usually served with white rice and a slice of avocado or avocado, additions that, 
        despite their popularity, are not traditional. For dessert, sweet papayuela or brevas in syrup and curuba 
        sorbet in milk are traditionally served.</p>
